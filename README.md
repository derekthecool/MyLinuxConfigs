# Dereks Linux Configuration Files

**This repo has been archived** in favor of https://github.com/derekthecool/MyCrossPlatformDotfiles
which is a cross platform dotfile setup.

This repository is MY Linux Distro! I primarily live in the terminal for
everything. Coding, journaling, email, web browsing... the list goes on.

**To be comfortable on your computer you need to cherish your dot file configuration 💖!**
